First we need to perform below mentioned pre-steps for configuration of Ansible Configuration Master (ACM and Hosts)

=========
Enable SSH 

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_Config
i
remove the # for  password Authentication Yes
Add # for 	  password Authentication No
:wq!

=========
Set password for user account, in current case i am setting for existing user account. 

passwd user_id
provide password when asked

=========
Provide access to user account. 

vim /etc/sudoers
i
under root user give this 

user_id = ALL=PASSWD: ALL
:wq!

========
Restart sshd on server. 
-------

Systemctl restart sshd

==========

Once above 4 steps are configured on both ACM and host generate key and 

on Ansible master, 

Login with account set earlier in step 1 

su user_id 
provide password

once logged in as user, 

ssh-keygen

press enter
press enter
press enter

ssh key will be generated

Step 2: copy key on to the host

	# ssh-copy-id -i ec2-user@private ip of host

press yes
enter passowrd ==>

ssh connection will be done
In the message we will have a command to loginto the host from ACM, execute it

	# ssh 'ec2-user@172.31.35.169'

we will be connected to the host

exit
back to ACM
